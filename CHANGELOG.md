# Changelog

All notable changes to `keryx` are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions follow semver.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-08

First tagged release. `keryx` installs a deterministic, local, offline,
git-diffable `.metaproject/` workspace of agent-facing tooling, with an opt-in
capability seam for model/embedding features (disabled = byte-identical, zero
runtime dependencies, no sockets).

### Core modules

- **gdgraph** — code graph, symbols, and affected context. Parser-backed import
  resolution (`Bun.Transpiler.scanImports`, regex fallback), N-hop transitive
  `affected`, token-budgeted `repomap.md`, and an opt-in tree-sitter symbol layer.
- **gdctx** — token-aware wrappers for search, reads, diffs, and command output.
- **gdwiki** — project knowledge base. Deterministic `collect` derives real
  per-module signals (dependencies, key files by connectivity, entry points,
  exported symbols) as prose-first drafts; an agent enrich workflow fills the
  understanding on a cheap model; `collect --changed` for incremental runs.
- **gdskills** — bundled working skills plus project-skill create/route/verify/
  learn lifecycle, schema-governed orchestration (`subagent-dispatch` →
  `subagent-result`, STATUS protocol), and a `docpack-orchestrator` for
  requirements packages.
- **health** — aggregated code health, scoring, quality gate, and a
  churn × complexity hotspot signal.
- **testing** — test context, related-test selection, normalized reports, and an
  opt-in coverage-map TIA with an always-on smoke tier.
- **memory** — long-lived project memory with bitemporal facts, memory typing,
  optional local embedding rerank, and `--as-of`/`--class` search.
- **tasks (flow)** — agent-first flow lifecycle: frozen acceptance criteria,
  a strict status state machine, PR-gated completion (AC + PR checks + health +
  security), tracker adapters (`gh`), and natural-language discovery.

### Platform

- **Metaproject Standard** — `standard validate|doctor|capabilities|emit`, a
  self-describing manifest, and profiles.
- **MCP interop** — `keryx mcp serve [--http]`: a stdio-first server mapping
  Tools to `createXService()` methods and Resources to read-only artifacts;
  `llms.txt` and gdskills plugin export.
- **Metaproject Security** — agent input/output/artifact security: secrets, PII,
  prompt-injection and exfiltration/egress detection with HMAC-keyed hashing,
  safe redaction, a config-integrity self-protect, write-seam gates, multi-runtime
  hooks, and a red-team eval harness (advisory by default).
- **Capability seam** — `resolveCapability(id) → Adapter | null`, `optionalDependencies`
  + lazy import, deterministic fallback as a tested path, and an asset resolver
  (`assets.lock.json`, `assets list|verify|pull`).

### Tooling & UX

- `keryx init` / `update` / `modules` / `dashboard` — TTY-aware styled output
  (banners, module status, next steps) that degrades to clean plain text off-TTY.
- **Human dashboard** — a dark-first, navigable HTML admin view with a health-score
  ring, module cards, an "Attention" section, a Tasks/flows summary, and an in-page
  markdown modal for every linked `.md`.

### Reliability

- Atomic `.metaproject` writes (temp + rename) so a crash never corrupts a
  single-source-of-truth file.
- File locks (dependency-free, atomic `mkdir`) around flow mutations and gdskills
  manifest/learn read-mutate-write, so concurrent AI-agent sessions never lose
  updates.
- Serialized `process.chdir` in tests — no cross-file cwd races.
