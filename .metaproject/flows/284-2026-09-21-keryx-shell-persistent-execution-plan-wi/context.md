1. [1.817] A shell allowlist matched against the raw command string is not a security boundary (lesson/accepted) - lessons/allowlist-not-a-boundary.md
   A remembered glob pattern that is matched against a command string which is then handed to `/bin/sh -c` grants far more than it appears to. The pattern matches text; the shell re-interprets that text. Verified, not theorised: a live allowlist contained `bash *`, `python3 *`, `curl *`, `cd *`, `# *`, `docker *`, `sudo *`, and the exact string `rm -rf /` — each an arbitrary-execution grant that auto-approved with no prompt.

   Session fixed /theme perception bug: applyTheme in shell-chrome.ts now repaints already-rendered chrome (transcript frames, tone block headers, dock buttons, sidebar panels) via themeColorToHex/themeColorRemap/recolorThemeTree, because OpenTUI stores colors as RGBA objects. Committed a6dd8dd, pushed to main. Lesson already accepted directly: .metaproject/memory/lessons/theme-switch-repaint.md (created via keryx memory new, bypassing SAC because no slate was open). This proposal records the work for review/audit.

3. [1.733] Theme switch repaints already-rendered chrome via old-slot value matching (lesson/accepted) - lessons/theme-switch-repaint.md
   `/theme` in the OpenTUI shell applied and persisted correctly on 0.2.66, but `applyTheme` (src/tui/shell-chrome.ts) only recolored the chrome's OWN surfaces (renderer background, sidebar border, docks, composer, `/`-menu). Every renderable painted EARLIER with `getTheme()` — transcript frames (user echoes, code-segment boxes, block bodies, side-worker boxes), tone-colored block headers (`theme.error`/`theme.tool`), dock/queue-dock buttons, sidebar panels — kept the old palette's hex in its `borderColor`/`backgroundColor`/`fg` props, so a dark→dark switch (groknight↔tokyonight) looked like "the theme did not apply". Fix: on every `applyTheme`, walk the renderable trees (transcript, docks, sidebarTop, menu, composer, header, footer) and rewrite any prop whose color equals an OLD theme slot hex to the NEW slot hex.

4. [1.719] Findings reach a review round through the report's keryx:findings block, and a round without one silently records none (known-mistake/accepted) - known-mistakes/review-ingest-discards-verdicts.md
   `keryx review ingest --report <md>` reads structured findings from a fenced ` ```json keryx:findings ` block inside the report. A report without that block ingests as `findings: in=0`, and every `--verifications` claim naming one of its findings is then discarded as unresolvable — because the finding it names is not in the round.

Direct child .ts files excluding .test.ts and subfolders: fake-provider.ts, make-provider.ts, provider-port.ts, single-turn.ts, tool-call-linking.ts, types.ts = 6 files. Subfolders (openai/, ollama/, gemini/, anthropic/, compat/, fixtures/) and their contents excluded per the no-subfolders constraint. Task required read-only; rounds T1-T4 (plan/test/PR) are generic placeholders not applicable to this read-only counting task.

## Agent Findings

- `src/commands/interactive-agent-tools.ts` is the single factory shared by
  TUI and readline. Registering plan tools there reaches both main-agent
  surfaces while child/subagent rosters remain isolated.
- `src/session/slate.ts` owns the lock-protected per-session `slate.json` and
  preserves additive optional fields across resume. A plan can be an optional
  Slate field without breaking existing sessions.
- `src/commands/goal-command.ts` confirms the current gap: `flow plan` is
  advisory text, and the interactive agent has no structured tool that can
  advance logical steps. Background Jobs describe subprocess lifecycle, not
  user-visible plan progress.
- `src/flow/types.ts` provides useful status semantics, but Flow is project
  lifecycle state. A lightweight conversation plan should not create or mutate
  a Flow automatically; a later adapter may project a bound Flow into the UI.
- `src/tui/tui-shell.ts` mounts `sbJobs` beneath status/subagents. A sibling
  hug-content Plan box immediately before it preserves sidebar scrolling.
- `src/commands/agent.ts` owns instructions and the tool loop. It is the seam
  for a bounded plan snapshot and one guarded continuation when work remains.
- `/plan` already toggles read-only permission mode. Keep that command and use
  tool names `plan_set`, `plan_update`, and `plan_get` for execution state.
