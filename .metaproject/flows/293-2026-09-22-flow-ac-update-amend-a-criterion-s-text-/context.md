1. [1.903] Flow ids are allocated per clone, not per checkout (constraint/accepted) - constraints/flow-ids-allocated-per-clone.md
   `flow init` reserves its number in the git common directory, so every linked worktree of one clone shares the id space. A number, once handed out, is never reused — not even after the flow directory is deleted or renumbered.

2. [1.824] OpenTUI: alignSelf on a transcript box collapses its intrinsic height (lesson/accepted) - lessons/tui-alignself-height-collapse.md
   In a `@opentui/core` ScrollBox column, a child `BoxRenderable` carrying `alignSelf: "flex-start"` stops measuring its intrinsic HEIGHT: it collapses to the viewport height, squeezes its children, and makes the ScrollBox under-report `scrollHeight`. Hug content with `maxWidth` instead.

3. [1.812] Findings reach a review round through the report's keryx:findings block, and a round without one silently records none (known-mistake/accepted) - known-mistakes/review-ingest-discards-verdicts.md
   `keryx review ingest --report <md>` reads structured findings from a fenced ` ```json keryx:findings ` block inside the report. A report without that block ingests as `findings: in=0`, and every `--verifications` claim naming one of its findings is then discarded as unresolvable — because the finding it names is not in the round.

4. [1.788] A shell allowlist matched against the raw command string is not a security boundary (lesson/accepted) - lessons/allowlist-not-a-boundary.md
   A remembered glob pattern that is matched against a command string which is then handed to `/bin/sh -c` grants far more than it appears to. The pattern matches text; the shell re-interprets that text. Verified, not theorised: a live allowlist contained `bash *`, `python3 *`, `curl *`, `cd *`, `# *`, `docker *`, `sudo *`, and the exact string `rm -rf /` — each an arbitrary-execution grant that auto-approved with no prompt.

5. [1.77] The keryx on PATH is a stale build; the review pipeline does not exercise the code under review (constraint/accepted) - constraints/stale-installed-keryx-binary.md
   `~/.local/bin/keryx` is an installed build, and its version lags the working tree. It is NOT the working tree. Every `keryx …` invocation — including `keryx review ingest`, which is how a managed review package is recorded — runs that build, so the review pipeline routinely does not exercise the code being reviewed.
