1. [1.588] Findings reach a review round through the report's keryx:findings block, and a round without one silently records none (known-mistake/accepted) - known-mistakes/review-ingest-discards-verdicts.md
   `keryx review ingest --report <md>` reads structured findings from a fenced ` ```json keryx:findings ` block inside the report. A report without that block ingests as `findings: in=0`, and every `--verifications` claim naming one of its findings is then discarded as unresolvable — because the finding it names is not in the round.

   provenance: source=manual link=https://github.com/MrCipherSmith/keryx/pull/499 author=MrCipherSmith confirmedBy=flow 243 closed through the gate on round r06 with 3 findings, 3 refuted verdicts, 0 discarded
   caveat: Version 0.2.0 of this entry asserted the opposite — that `review ingest`
2. [1.583] gdctx-flag-allowlist-no-bundle-expansion (known-mistake/accepted) - known-mistakes/gdctx-flag-allowlist-no-bundle-expansion.md
   A per-flag string allowlist that doesn't expand POSIX-bundled short flags rejects the idiomatic form of a tool's own CLI habits (`-il` vs `-i -l`); expand-then-check, not check-then-reject, for any allowlisted boolean-flag set.

3. [1.583] gdctx-redaction-ignores-trust-tag (known-mistake/accepted) - known-mistakes/gdctx-redaction-ignores-trust-tag.md
   A `SecuritySource` tag (`trusted-project`) can be threaded all the way to a redaction call and still have zero effect on the policy outcome if the resolver only branches on `category`. Verify a trust axis actually changes a decision before shipping the tag, not just that the tag is present in the type.

   A keyword-stem classifier applied to raw stdout regardless of exit code turns ordinary English ("refuse," "cannot," "crash") into a false tool-failure signal. Gate stem-matching on stderr or a non-zero exit code, not on the words alone.

   A mandatory context-injection rule's per-read cost multiplies by every subsequent turn and every subagent dispatch. Measure the re-billed cost across a realistic turn count and subagent fan-out before setting a rule's default scope, not just its one-time size.
