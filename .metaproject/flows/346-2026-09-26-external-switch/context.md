1. [1.779] gdctx-redaction-ignores-trust-tag (known-mistake/accepted) - known-mistakes/gdctx-redaction-ignores-trust-tag.md
   A `SecuritySource` tag (`trusted-project`) can be threaded all the way to a redaction call and still have zero effect on the policy outcome if the resolver only branches on `category`. Verify a trust axis actually changes a decision before shipping the tag, not just that the tag is present in the type.

   A keyword-stem classifier applied to raw stdout regardless of exit code turns ordinary English ("refuse," "cannot," "crash") into a false tool-failure signal. Gate stem-matching on stderr or a non-zero exit code, not on the words alone.

3. [1.779] Theme switch repaints already-rendered chrome via old-slot value matching (lesson/accepted) - lessons/theme-switch-repaint.md
   `/theme` in the OpenTUI shell applied and persisted correctly on 0.2.66, but `applyTheme` (src/tui/shell-chrome.ts) only recolored the chrome's OWN surfaces (renderer background, sidebar border, docks, composer, `/`-menu). Every renderable painted EARLIER with `getTheme()` — transcript frames (user echoes, code-segment boxes, block bodies, side-worker boxes), tone-colored block headers (`theme.error`/`theme.tool`), dock/queue-dock buttons, sidebar panels — kept the old palette's hex in its `borderColor`/`backgroundColor`/`fg` props, so a dark→dark switch (groknight↔tokyonight) looked like "the theme did not apply". Fix: on every `applyTheme`, walk the renderable trees (transcript, docks, sidebarTop, menu, composer, header, footer) and rewrite any prop whose color equals an OLD theme slot hex to the NEW slot hex.

   Session fixed /theme perception bug: applyTheme in shell-chrome.ts now repaints already-rendered chrome (transcript frames, tone block headers, dock buttons, sidebar panels) via themeColorToHex/themeColorRemap/recolorThemeTree, because OpenTUI stores colors as RGBA objects. Committed a6dd8dd, pushed to main. Lesson already accepted directly: .metaproject/memory/lessons/theme-switch-repaint.md (created via keryx memory new, bypassing SAC because no slate was open). This proposal records the work for review/audit.

5. [1.644] Flow ids are allocated per clone, not per checkout (constraint/accepted) - constraints/flow-ids-allocated-per-clone.md
   `flow init` reserves its number in the git common directory, so every linked worktree of one clone shares the id space. A number, once handed out, is never reused — not even after the flow directory is deleted or renumbered.
