1. [1.738] gdctx-stem-classifier-misreads-stdout (known-mistake/accepted) - known-mistakes/gdctx-stem-classifier-misreads-stdout.md
   A keyword-stem classifier applied to raw stdout regardless of exit code turns ordinary English ("refuse," "cannot," "crash") into a false tool-failure signal. Gate stem-matching on stderr or a non-zero exit code, not on the words alone.

   A mandatory context-injection rule's per-read cost multiplies by every subsequent turn and every subagent dispatch. Measure the re-billed cost across a realistic turn count and subagent fan-out before setting a rule's default scope, not just its one-time size.

3. [1.656] A shell allowlist matched against the raw command string is not a security boundary (lesson/accepted) - lessons/allowlist-not-a-boundary.md
   A remembered glob pattern that is matched against a command string which is then handed to `/bin/sh -c` grants far more than it appears to. The pattern matches text; the shell re-interprets that text. Verified, not theorised: a live allowlist contained `bash *`, `python3 *`, `curl *`, `cd *`, `# *`, `docker *`, `sudo *`, and the exact string `rm -rf /` — each an arbitrary-execution grant that auto-approved with no prompt.

   A per-flag string allowlist that doesn't expand POSIX-bundled short flags rejects the idiomatic form of a tool's own CLI habits (`-il` vs `-i -l`); expand-then-check, not check-then-reject, for any allowlisted boolean-flag set.

5. [1.58] Theme switch repaints already-rendered chrome via old-slot value matching (lesson/accepted) - lessons/theme-switch-repaint.md
   `/theme` in the OpenTUI shell applied and persisted correctly on 0.2.66, but `applyTheme` (src/tui/shell-chrome.ts) only recolored the chrome's OWN surfaces (renderer background, sidebar border, docks, composer, `/`-menu). Every renderable painted EARLIER with `getTheme()` — transcript frames (user echoes, code-segment boxes, block bodies, side-worker boxes), tone-colored block headers (`theme.error`/`theme.tool`), dock/queue-dock buttons, sidebar panels — kept the old palette's hex in its `borderColor`/`backgroundColor`/`fg` props, so a dark→dark switch (groknight↔tokyonight) looked like "the theme did not apply". Fix: on every `applyTheme`, walk the renderable trees (transcript, docks, sidebarTop, menu, composer, header, footer) and rewrite any prop whose color equals an OLD theme slot hex to the NEW slot hex.

### Verified inspection and brainstorm

Working-tree inspection on fix/tui-input-latency. Graph index-incomplete (no nodes): generated artifact pointers above are not impact evidence. Wiki used only for orientation.

- src/commands/agent.ts:3320-3538: provider_error breaks stream and returns {}, except context-overflow recovery. Partial text mutates history; tool execution follows error-return boundary (3824+). Audit EOF/partial reasoning.
- src/commands/shell.ts:2519-2563: runAgentTurn returns, turn_end emitted, input loop resumes.
- src/tui/tui-shell.ts:9593: separate foreground dispatch; tui-shell.test.ts and turn-guard-shell-wiring.test.ts cover IO/lifecycle.
- src/harness/provider/openai/openai-provider.ts:313+: 401 authentication; 429 retryable rate_limit; 5xx retryable unavailable; generic 403 invalid_request/retryable:false. Network fetch errors unavailable; remote continuation not promised.
- src/harness/provider/openai-codex/openai-codex-provider.ts:39-79: one forced auth refresh before events escape; generic 403 does not enter this path.
- Regression suites: shell.test.ts currently expects next input after error; agent.overflow-retry.test.ts, agent.error-hint.test.ts, agent-tool-call-budget.test.ts, provider adapter tests, tui-shell.test.ts.
- Read-only feature-analyzer/brainstorm worker recovery-flow-analysis: STATUS DONE. Compared adapter-only retry, same-turn supervisor, shell new-turn continuation; recommends same-turn supervisor. Risks: partial history, duplicate effects, retry storms, budget resets, cancel races. Worker made no edits.
- User effect: no action after recoverable outage/recovery. Long outage must not require «continue» after a small retry batch; permanent errors/hard limits explicit exceptions. Owner not inferred; implementation not started in this initialization session.
