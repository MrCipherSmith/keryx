1. [2.124] OpenTUI: alignSelf on a transcript box collapses its intrinsic height (lesson/accepted) - lessons/tui-alignself-height-collapse.md
   In a `@opentui/core` ScrollBox column, a child `BoxRenderable` carrying `alignSelf: "flex-start"` stops measuring its intrinsic HEIGHT: it collapses to the viewport height, squeezes its children, and makes the ScrollBox under-report `scrollHeight`. Hug content with `maxWidth` instead.

2. [1.875] A shell allowlist matched against the raw command string is not a security boundary (lesson/accepted) - lessons/allowlist-not-a-boundary.md
   A remembered glob pattern that is matched against a command string which is then handed to `/bin/sh -c` grants far more than it appears to. The pattern matches text; the shell re-interprets that text. Verified, not theorised: a live allowlist contained `bash *`, `python3 *`, `curl *`, `cd *`, `# *`, `docker *`, `sudo *`, and the exact string `rm -rf /` — each an arbitrary-execution grant that auto-approved with no prompt.

3. [1.848] gdctx-redaction-ignores-trust-tag (known-mistake/accepted) - known-mistakes/gdctx-redaction-ignores-trust-tag.md
   A `SecuritySource` tag (`trusted-project`) can be threaded all the way to a redaction call and still have zero effect on the policy outcome if the resolver only branches on `category`. Verify a trust axis actually changes a decision before shipping the tag, not just that the tag is present in the type.

   A keyword-stem classifier applied to raw stdout regardless of exit code turns ordinary English ("refuse," "cannot," "crash") into a false tool-failure signal. Gate stem-matching on stderr or a non-zero exit code, not on the words alone.

   A mandatory context-injection rule's per-read cost multiplies by every subsequent turn and every subagent dispatch. Measure the re-billed cost across a realistic turn count and subagent fan-out before setting a rule's default scope, not just its one-time size.

## Agent Findings

Design context (read-only agent, 2026-10-15, main 1675e4336):
- 7 TTY gates + schedule actions; anchors in description.md table. Approval floor `touchesHumanConfirmation` src/lib/command-risk.ts:625-627.
- shell_exec spawns `/bin/sh -c` with env = process.env minus credentials + `KERYX_TOOL_CALL=1` (src/harness/process/shell-spawn.ts:126-154); model controls env; sandbox off by default; no TUI→child channel the model cannot reach; bus is files (src/bus/paths.ts).
- ask_user is NOT trusted: answered by answers file / arbiter / review-auto (src/tui/ask-user-bridge.ts:60-97), answer returns through the model.
- Trusted pattern: `InteractiveTool.confirmation()` → `{card, token}` (src/harness/tool/builtin/interactive-tools.ts:77-88); driver forces ask in every mode (src/commands/agent.ts:5955-5970, :6010), denies when unattended (:6003-6005), token to invoke only after yes (:6092); single-use UUID (src/commands/schedule-tools.ts:184-203); TUI renders card verbatim, never remembered (src/tui/tui-shell.ts:5283-5295, 5423-5428); registration src/commands/interactive-agent-tools.ts:253; unattended list src/trigger/unattended.ts:51.
- TM-03 token (src/flow/confirm-token.ts:103-212): binding template (subject, digest, TTL, single use); not a human proof by itself.
- Remote approvals exist (src/remote/, commit a556a84af) — check whether cards are mirrored.

Owner decisions: all gates; recorded quote = card text + "yes" (optional comment); implement now.
