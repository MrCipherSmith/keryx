1. [1.847] A shell allowlist matched against the raw command string is not a security boundary (lesson/accepted) - lessons/allowlist-not-a-boundary.md
   A remembered glob pattern that is matched against a command string which is then handed to `/bin/sh -c` grants far more than it appears to. The pattern matches text; the shell re-interprets that text. Verified, not theorised: a live allowlist contained `bash *`, `python3 *`, `curl *`, `cd *`, `# *`, `docker *`, `sudo *`, and the exact string `rm -rf /` — each an arbitrary-execution grant that auto-approved with no prompt.

2. [1.81] Theme switch repaints already-rendered chrome via old-slot value matching (lesson/accepted) - lessons/theme-switch-repaint.md
   `/theme` in the OpenTUI shell applied and persisted correctly on 0.2.66, but `applyTheme` (src/tui/shell-chrome.ts) only recolored the chrome's OWN surfaces (renderer background, sidebar border, docks, composer, `/`-menu). Every renderable painted EARLIER with `getTheme()` — transcript frames (user echoes, code-segment boxes, block bodies, side-worker boxes), tone-colored block headers (`theme.error`/`theme.tool`), dock/queue-dock buttons, sidebar panels — kept the old palette's hex in its `borderColor`/`backgroundColor`/`fg` props, so a dark→dark switch (groknight↔tokyonight) looked like "the theme did not apply". Fix: on every `applyTheme`, walk the renderable trees (transcript, docks, sidebarTop, menu, composer, header, footer) and rewrite any prop whose color equals an OLD theme slot hex to the NEW slot hex.

3. [1.745] OpenTUI: alignSelf on a transcript box collapses its intrinsic height (lesson/accepted) - lessons/tui-alignself-height-collapse.md
   In a `@opentui/core` ScrollBox column, a child `BoxRenderable` carrying `alignSelf: "flex-start"` stops measuring its intrinsic HEIGHT: it collapses to the viewport height, squeezes its children, and makes the ScrollBox under-report `scrollHeight`. Hug content with `maxWidth` instead.

4. [1.678] gdctx-flag-allowlist-no-bundle-expansion (known-mistake/accepted) - known-mistakes/gdctx-flag-allowlist-no-bundle-expansion.md
   A per-flag string allowlist that doesn't expand POSIX-bundled short flags rejects the idiomatic form of a tool's own CLI habits (`-il` vs `-i -l`); expand-then-check, not check-then-reject, for any allowlisted boolean-flag set.

   A `SecuritySource` tag (`trusted-project`) can be threaded all the way to a redaction call and still have zero effect on the policy outcome if the resolver only branches on `category`. Verify a trust axis actually changes a decision before shipping the tag, not just that the tag is present in the type.
