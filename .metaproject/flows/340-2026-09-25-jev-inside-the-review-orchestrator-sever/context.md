1. [1.96] Findings reach a review round through the report's keryx:findings block, and a round without one silently records none (known-mistake/accepted) - known-mistakes/review-ingest-discards-verdicts.md
   `keryx review ingest --report <md>` reads structured findings from a fenced ` ```json keryx:findings ` block inside the report. A report without that block ingests as `findings: in=0`, and every `--verifications` claim naming one of its findings is then discarded as unresolvable — because the finding it names is not in the round.

2. [1.757] Theme switch repaints already-rendered chrome via old-slot value matching (lesson/accepted) - lessons/theme-switch-repaint.md
   `/theme` in the OpenTUI shell applied and persisted correctly on 0.2.66, but `applyTheme` (src/tui/shell-chrome.ts) only recolored the chrome's OWN surfaces (renderer background, sidebar border, docks, composer, `/`-menu). Every renderable painted EARLIER with `getTheme()` — transcript frames (user echoes, code-segment boxes, block bodies, side-worker boxes), tone-colored block headers (`theme.error`/`theme.tool`), dock/queue-dock buttons, sidebar panels — kept the old palette's hex in its `borderColor`/`backgroundColor`/`fg` props, so a dark→dark switch (groknight↔tokyonight) looked like "the theme did not apply". Fix: on every `applyTheme`, walk the renderable trees (transcript, docks, sidebarTop, menu, composer, header, footer) and rewrite any prop whose color equals an OLD theme slot hex to the NEW slot hex.

3. [1.672] A fix round needs its own review: three consecutive rounds each introduced a blocker (lesson/accepted) - lessons/a-fix-round-needs-its-own-review-three-consecutive-rounds-each-introduced-a-blocker.md
   On PR #215 (flow 127, project registry) three consecutive review-fix rounds each introduced a new blocker while closing the previous one. The defect was not in any single fix; it was in treating a fix as finished once it addressed the reported symptom.

   A per-flag string allowlist that doesn't expand POSIX-bundled short flags rejects the idiomatic form of a tool's own CLI habits (`-il` vs `-i -l`); expand-then-check, not check-then-reject, for any allowlisted boolean-flag set.

   A mandatory context-injection rule's per-read cost multiplies by every subsequent turn and every subagent dispatch. Measure the re-billed cost across a realistic turn count and subagent fan-out before setting a rule's default scope, not just its one-time size.
