   A mandatory context-injection rule's per-read cost multiplies by every subsequent turn and every subagent dispatch. Measure the re-billed cost across a realistic turn count and subagent fan-out before setting a rule's default scope, not just its one-time size.

2. [1.9] gdctx-redaction-ignores-trust-tag (known-mistake/accepted) - known-mistakes/gdctx-redaction-ignores-trust-tag.md
   A `SecuritySource` tag (`trusted-project`) can be threaded all the way to a redaction call and still have zero effect on the policy outcome if the resolver only branches on `category`. Verify a trust axis actually changes a decision before shipping the tag, not just that the tag is present in the type.

   On PR #215 (flow 127, project registry) three consecutive review-fix rounds each introduced a new blocker while closing the previous one. The defect was not in any single fix; it was in treating a fix as finished once it addressed the reported symptom.

5. [1.689] Theme switch repaints already-rendered chrome via old-slot value matching (lesson/accepted) - lessons/theme-switch-repaint.md
   `/theme` in the OpenTUI shell applied and persisted correctly on 0.2.66, but `applyTheme` (src/tui/shell-chrome.ts) only recolored the chrome's OWN surfaces (renderer background, sidebar border, docks, composer, `/`-menu). Every renderable painted EARLIER with `getTheme()` — transcript frames (user echoes, code-segment boxes, block bodies, side-worker boxes), tone-colored block headers (`theme.error`/`theme.tool`), dock/queue-dock buttons, sidebar panels — kept the old palette's hex in its `borderColor`/`backgroundColor`/`fg` props, so a dark→dark switch (groknight↔tokyonight) looked like "the theme did not apply". Fix: on every `applyTheme`, walk the renderable trees (transcript, docks, sidebarTop, menu, composer, header, footer) and rewrite any prop whose color equals an OLD theme slot hex to the NEW slot hex.
