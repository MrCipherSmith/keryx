1. [1.73] gdctx-flag-allowlist-no-bundle-expansion (known-mistake/accepted) - known-mistakes/gdctx-flag-allowlist-no-bundle-expansion.md
   A per-flag string allowlist that doesn't expand POSIX-bundled short flags rejects the idiomatic form of a tool's own CLI habits (`-il` vs `-i -l`); expand-then-check, not check-then-reject, for any allowlisted boolean-flag set.

2. [1.73] gdctx-stem-classifier-misreads-stdout (known-mistake/accepted) - known-mistakes/gdctx-stem-classifier-misreads-stdout.md
   A keyword-stem classifier applied to raw stdout regardless of exit code turns ordinary English ("refuse," "cannot," "crash") into a false tool-failure signal. Gate stem-matching on stderr or a non-zero exit code, not on the words alone.

   A mandatory context-injection rule's per-read cost multiplies by every subsequent turn and every subagent dispatch. Measure the re-billed cost across a realistic turn count and subagent fan-out before setting a rule's default scope, not just its one-time size.

4. [1.632] Flow ids are allocated per clone, not per checkout (constraint/accepted) - constraints/flow-ids-allocated-per-clone.md
   `flow init` reserves its number in the git common directory, so every linked worktree of one clone shares the id space. A number, once handed out, is never reused — not even after the flow directory is deleted or renumbered.

5. [1.576] gdctx-redaction-ignores-trust-tag (known-mistake/accepted) - known-mistakes/gdctx-redaction-ignores-trust-tag.md
   A `SecuritySource` tag (`trusted-project`) can be threaded all the way to a redaction call and still have zero effect on the policy outcome if the resolver only branches on `category`. Verify a trust axis actually changes a decision before shipping the tag, not just that the tag is present in the type.
