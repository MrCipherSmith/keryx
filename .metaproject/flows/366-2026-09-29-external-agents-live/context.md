1. [1.686] gdctx-flag-allowlist-no-bundle-expansion (known-mistake/accepted) - known-mistakes/gdctx-flag-allowlist-no-bundle-expansion.md
   A per-flag string allowlist that doesn't expand POSIX-bundled short flags rejects the idiomatic form of a tool's own CLI habits (`-il` vs `-i -l`); expand-then-check, not check-then-reject, for any allowlisted boolean-flag set.

   A keyword-stem classifier applied to raw stdout regardless of exit code turns ordinary English ("refuse," "cannot," "crash") into a false tool-failure signal. Gate stem-matching on stderr or a non-zero exit code, not on the words alone.

   A mandatory context-injection rule's per-read cost multiplies by every subsequent turn and every subagent dispatch. Measure the re-billed cost across a realistic turn count and subagent fan-out before setting a rule's default scope, not just its one-time size.

4. [1.573] A fix round needs its own review: three consecutive rounds each introduced a blocker (lesson/accepted) - lessons/a-fix-round-needs-its-own-review-three-consecutive-rounds-each-introduced-a-blocker.md
   On PR #215 (flow 127, project registry) three consecutive review-fix rounds each introduced a new blocker while closing the previous one. The defect was not in any single fix; it was in treating a fix as finished once it addressed the reported symptom.

5. [1.553] Flow ids are allocated per clone, not per checkout (constraint/accepted) - constraints/flow-ids-allocated-per-clone.md
   `flow init` reserves its number in the git common directory, so every linked worktree of one clone shares the id space. A number, once handed out, is never reused — not even after the flow directory is deleted or renumbered.
