  MSW-style boundary mocks, behaviour assertions, deterministic waits,
  smoke/full split, locator priority, and screenshot-test discipline.

# Review — Testing Practices

Reviewer for local testing discipline. Read project test guides first when present, then apply
the neutral baseline below.

---

## Scope

Applicable paths commonly include:

- `**/*.test.ts`, `**/*.test.tsx`, `**/*.spec.ts`, `**/*.spec.tsx`
- `**/*.integration.test.ts`, `**/*.integration.test.tsx`
- `**/*.msw.ts`, `test/**`, `src/test/**`
- `*.stories.tsx`, Storybook specs
- `e2e/**`, Playwright/Cypress page objects and fixtures

If the repository has local test documentation, cite the relevant convention in findings.

---

## Checklist

### Test Location and Tiers

- Tests live near the code they cover unless the repository has a deliberate central test layout.
- Shared test infrastructure folders are not used as buckets for feature tests.
- Unit, integration, component, and e2e tiers are named and routed consistently.
- Fast feedback lanes stay fast; screenshot/component/e2e suites are not used for cheap unit
  assertions.
- Coverage gates focus on changed risk, not low-value tests for trivial getters.

### Network and Boundary Mocking

- For data-fetching UI, prefer rendering the real component/store and mocking only the network
  boundary.
- Avoid mocking the API module in integration tests when the repository has network-level mock
  infrastructure.
- Unhandled network requests fail loudly instead of silently hitting the real world.
- Mock handlers/fixtures are colocated and reusable by tests/stories where practical.
- Handler paths match the runtime test environment and avoid hard-coded origins unless required.

### Behaviour Assertions

- Assert on user-visible DOM, callbacks, toasts, emitted events, or public state.
- Do not reach into private methods or internal fields unless the unit under test is explicitly a
  low-level utility.
- Store-internal timing and concurrency can be unit-tested with lower-level mocks when that is
  the clean seam.

### Browser and E2E Determinism

- Tests create their own artifacts with unique names and assert on those artifacts.
- Avoid mutating or deleting seeded/shared environment data.
- Avoid env-wide assertions such as exact global counts, `.first()`, or `.nth(N)` unless the test
  owns the full dataset.
- No fixed sleeps; wait on assertions, events, responses, or polling predicates.
- Backend-dependent assertions wait on the response/event that proves the backend completed.
- Smoke tags are reserved for fast, reliable, load-bearing baseline flows.
- Locator priority prefers stable test ids and accessible roles over raw CSS selectors.
- Screenshot tests are avoided for heavy, unstable, or non-deterministic surfaces unless the
  repository explicitly supports them.

### Local Type and Build Gotchas

- Account for incremental compiler caches when validating newly added files.
- Generated/vendored files that are outside the lint/type project are ignored centrally rather
  than hand-formatted into compliance.

## Iron Laws

### Shared laws (every reviewer)

1. **A claim of runtime harm with no reproducible path is `info`.** If you cannot
   name the input, call, or condition that reaches the code, you have an
   observation, not a finding. Report it as `info` and say what would settle it.
2. **Never flag the theoretical.** The path you describe must exist in the code
   under review. Do not report a safe API because it could be misused, or a
   pattern because it is often wrong elsewhere.
3. **One finding per class, not one per occurrence.** When the same shape appears
   at several sites, report it once and list every site. Ten findings that are one
   finding hide the other nine problems.

Severity levels are defined once, in `review-orchestrator/SKILL.md` →
**Severity (canonical)**. This reviewer does not restate them: `blocker` is the
four merge-blocking shapes named there and nothing else, and the `major`/`minor`
boundary is the trigger-and-outcome test.

---

## Orchestrated Review Contract

When dispatched by `review-orchestrator`, follow the provided `reviewer-input.schema.json` payload. Return a `REVIEW_RESULT` object compatible with `skills/review/review-orchestrator/reviewer-finding.schema.json`, then a concise markdown summary. Keep findings evidence-based, include concrete `suggested_fix` for every blocker/major, and return `NEEDS_CONTEXT` instead of guessing when required context is missing.

---

## Finding Format

### Class scope — required for `blocker` and `major`

Every `blocker` and `major` finding must carry `class_scope`: **every** site that
holds the shape you found, and **how you enumerated them** — the grep or query
you ran, or the guard that derives the set.

A finding anchored to one `file:line` is a claim about one site. The recorded
history of this repository is that a fix then repairs that site and leaves its
siblings: one writer of five, one operator instruction of four, six readers of
eight. Each was found by the *next* review round, which is why reviews here have
run to seven and four rounds instead of one.

```yaml
class_scope:
  sites: ["src/lib/shell-config.ts:60", "src/session/store.ts:133"]
  enumeration_method: "grep for the config-path resolvers; 7 writers, 2 unguarded"
```

"I checked the others" is not an enumeration method. A single-entry `sites` list
is a claim that the class has exactly one member — make it deliberately, because
`review-finding.schema.json` accepts it and the next round tests it.

`minor` and `info` may omit it: enumerating the class for every low-severity
observation is theatre, not rigour.

```markdown
### [F-NNN] Title

- **Severity**: blocker | major | minor | info
- **File**: path/to/test.ts:line
- **Problem**: which testing rule is violated
- **Why it matters**: determinism, confidence, CI runtime, or maintenance impact
- **Fix**: concrete test rewrite or fixture/handler change
```

Severity comes from **Severity (canonical)** in `review-orchestrator/SKILL.md`.
This reviewer keeps no rubric of its own; what follows is where its recurring
conditions land under that rubric.

| Condition | Severity | Why, under the canonical rubric |
|---|---|---|
| A test that passes while the behaviour it names is broken | `blocker` | The acceptance criterion is unimplemented — the test only claims otherwise |
| Real-network leak; shared-data mutation across tests; fixed sleeps; asserting on a backend race | `major` | Named trigger (the run) and named outcome (flake or a false pass) |
| Substrate choice, smoke tagging, locator priority, co-location | `minor` | The suite is correct; the cost is to whoever maintains it |
| A convention preference with no effect on determinism or signal | `info` | Shared laws 1 and 2 |

A flaky test is `major`, not `blocker`: it wastes time, but it does not ship a
defect. A test that cannot fail does — which is why it is the one `blocker` here.
