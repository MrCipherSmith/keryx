# Review Orchestrator — detail

Overflow reference for `review/review-orchestrator`, linked from its SKILL.md.
Read the section SKILL.md points you to; nothing here overrides SKILL.md.

## Project-local reviewers

`keryx review reviewers --json` returns every project-skill under module
`review`. The routing tables in SKILL.md cannot name a project reviewer's
triggers, so each `project` entry carries its own. Use them; do not re-derive
them from the reviewer's prose.

### Selecting project reviewers — the same two filters, from the inventory

| Field | Use |
|---|---|
| `flags` | A flag the user passed that is in this list selects the reviewer **explicitly** — it is then never path-gated, like any flag-selected reviewer. `--all` selects every project reviewer. |
| `paths` | Its path triggers for the **path gate**. No file in scope A matches → `Skipped reviewers`, reason `no-matching-paths`. |
| `pathsSource` | `metadata` (declared `metadata.paths`) or `description` (globs read out of its description). `none` means there is nothing to gate on: **dispatch it** — ambiguity includes. |
| `stackRequires` | Apply stack scoping exactly as for a bundled reviewer carrying `metadata.stack_requires`. |
| `unresolvedRules` | Rules it cites that the project does not have. Dispatch it anyway, tell it in the prompt which rules are absent, and name them once in the report with the fix (`keryx review import --from <overlay>` copies them). Never a finding against the code. |

A description saying another entry point dispatches it ("Dispatched by
vantage-review …") is its author's routing note, not a restriction: this
orchestrator dispatches it through the fields above.

### `drift` — the source moved, the reviewer did not

A project reviewer built from an external file — a rules file, a review profile,
a conventions doc — records where it came from and the hash of that file at
import. `keryx review reviewers` re-reads the source and reports:

| `drift` | Meaning | What to do this round |
|---|---|---|
| `none` | No external source; written here | Nothing |
| `clean` | Source matches the import | Nothing |
| `changed` | Source has moved on since import | Dispatch it, and say so in the report |
| `missing` | Source can no longer be read | Dispatch it, and say so in the report |

**A drifted reviewer still runs.** It is a reviewer built from an older version
of its source, which is a fact about provenance, not a defect in its findings —
suppressing it would trade real coverage for tidiness. Record the drift in
`review_context` and name it once in the report, so the next person knows the
profile is due a re-read. Never file it as a finding against the code under
review: it is a fact about the review, not about the diff.

## CLI-engine reviewers — dispatched as a command, not a sub-agent

`review-jev-rules` (flow 330), `review-jev-risk` and `review-jev-scenarios`
(both flow 332), `review-jev-docs` and `review-jev-comments` (flow 333), and
`review-jev-contract` (flow 335) are ADDITIONAL reviewers, never replacing
any other, and their dispatch mechanism differs from every reviewer named in
SKILL.md's Routing Table: there is no platform-native agent to invoke,
because each is a deterministic **keryx program**. Run them with `keryx
review jev-rules --scope <scope.json> --json`, `keryx review jev-risk
--scope <scope.json> --json`, and `keryx review jev-scenarios --scope
<scope.json> --json` — the SAME `scope.json` every other Wave A/B reviewer's
dispatch already reads, so each checks exactly the same hunks.
`review-jev-docs` and `review-jev-comments` take a diff/PR target instead:
`keryx review jev-docs (--diff <ref>|--pr <n>) --json` and `keryx review
jev-comments --pr <n> --repo <owner/repo> --json`. `review-jev-contract`
also takes a diff/PR target, plus an optional linked flow: `keryx review
jev-contract (--diff <ref>|--pr <n>) [--flow <id>] --json` — a `--pr` target
checks the description's own claims; `--flow <id>` additionally checks that
flow's frozen acceptance criteria (reusing flow 328's `check-ac.ts`, see its
own SKILL.md). Read each `--json` output as a `REVIEW_RESULT` and merge its
`findings` into the consolidated array exactly like a sub-agent reviewer's:
same Sub-Agent Report Quality Gate, same dedup, same Wave C verification.
`review-jev-risk` additionally emits `ranked` and `routingHints`;
`review-jev-scenarios` additionally emits `checklist`; `review-jev-contract`
additionally emits `claims`, `budget`, and (when `--flow` was given)
`acCheck` — see each reviewer's own SKILL.md for what to do with its extra.

Gate each BEFORE running its command, not after: skip it — recorded in
`Skipped reviewers` with the reason, never silently absent — when its own
opt-in (`review.jev.rules` / `review.jev.risk` / `review.jev.scenarios` /
`review.jev.docs` / `review.jev.comments` / `review.jev.contract`) is not
`true` in `.metaproject/tasks.config.json`, or when no Jev/OpenRouter
credential is resolvable. Either gate failing means the command itself would
refuse before any read or network call, so checking first saves a doomed
dispatch. The six opt-ins are independent: any subset may be on.
`review-jev-comments` additionally needs a comment ledger to already exist
(`keryx review comments collect` run first) — it refuses, before any read,
when there is none. When `review.jev.contract` is on, dispatch
`review-jev-contract` with `--pr` (never `--diff`, which has no description
to check) and let its `findings` cover the description-vs-diff claim, in
place of the by-eye Stage 1 judgement described in SKILL.md's "This gate owns
the description-vs-diff comparison" — see that section's own note.

`keryx review reviewers --json` marks a CLI-engine reviewer with
`"engine": "jev"` on its `bundled` entry — the field's presence, not its
absence, is what distinguishes it from the default (an LLM sub-agent
dispatch). A future engine-backed reviewer follows the same pattern: gate on
its own opt-in and reachability, dispatch as a command, merge its `--json`
output the same way.

### Measured verdicts (flow 344 — a live benchmark on a large production React/MobX frontend)

Gating them on is still a project's own choice; these are RESULTS, not a change to the gates above.

| Reviewer | Verdict | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| `review-jev-risk` | **Off by default** — measured weaker than a strong model | Top-3 recall 21% vs. "largest diff first" 30%; Sonnet 5 alone: 44%. |
| `review-jev-contract` | **Off by default** — measured weaker than a strong model | Caught 12.5% of false PR-description claims vs. Sonnet 5's 67.5%. |
| `review-jev-rules` | **Not useful on top of a strong reviewer** | Dispatched as an EXTRA reviewer beside an already-strong reviewer: +0 findings. |
| `review-jev-scenarios` | Experimental — not measured | — |
| `review-jev-docs` | Experimental — not measured | — |
| `review-jev-comments` | Experimental — not measured | — |

By contrast, `keryx review ci-triage` (Step 0b, not a reviewer) and `keryx
review jev-select` (Step 5c, not a reviewer either) both have a measured case
FOR them: CI triage cut developer minutes per failure from 30 to 15.4 under an
explicit cost model (38% vs. 25% flaky/regression/infra accuracy against
Sonnet 5 reading the same log, p=0.035); reviewer *selection* is the
unmeasured lever this benchmark named as most promising, which is why
`jev-select` ships recall-first and fails open rather than waiting for a
measurement that has not run yet. Full numbers, methodology and the cost
model: `docs/docs/jev-in-review.md`.

## `jev-triage` — advisory annotations, not a reviewer (Step 9b)

`review-jev-triage` (flow 340) is a DIFFERENT shape from every CLI-engine
reviewer above: it never produces a `findings` array of its own, and it is
never merged into the consolidated array. It runs AFTER the Sub-Agent Report
Quality Gate has already validated/merged/deduplicated the round's findings
(Step 9) and BEFORE Wave C verification (Step 10) — Step 9b in the Workflow
block — annotating the findings that already exist. It is advisory and
annotate-only by construction: nothing it returns drops or demotes a finding,
and no downstream step is permitted to treat its output as anything but a
hint.

Run it once per round, over the round's own consolidated findings:

```bash
keryx review jev-triage --report <this round's review package dir> --json
```

Gate it the same way as every other CLI-engine reviewer: skip it — recorded
in `Skipped reviewers` with the reason — when `review.jev.triage` is not
`true` in `.metaproject/tasks.config.json`, or when no Jev/OpenRouter
credential is resolvable. Either gate failing means the command itself would
refuse before any read or network call.

Its `--json` output is `{status, reviewer: "review-jev-triage", summary,
annotations, budget, tokens}` — never a `REVIEW_RESULT` merged into the
findings array. `annotations` carries three tracks, each read and used
differently in the report:

| Track | Shape | What to do with it |
|---|---|---|
| `severity_check` | `{id, p, flagged}` per blocker/major finding — `flagged` means `p < 0.4` | Show `flagged` findings as a soft note next to their existing severity ("Jev's own trigger+outcome check scored this low"). Never change the finding's `severity` field from this alone. |
| `merge_candidates` | `{id, a, b, reason, p}` per candidate pair | A high `p` is a suggestion to a human that `a` and `b` may be the same defect — surface it in the report as a note on both findings. Never merge, drop, or renumber either finding from this alone. |
| `verify_order` | `{id, p}`, sorted lowest-`p`-first | Feed this order into Wave C's own dispatch — verify the lowest-plausibility findings first — never as a reason to skip verifying any of them. |

`status` is `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` — never `DONE` — when any `severity_check` is
`flagged` OR any `merge_candidates` pair scores `p >= 0.5`
(`LIKELY_DUPLICATE_THRESHOLD`, `src/commands/review-jev-triage.ts`). Live-check
calibration found same-file pairs that were NOT duplicates scoring around
0.6, so a merge candidate above the threshold is a prompt to look, never a
merge — the status flip is a nudge to read the pair, not a verdict that the
findings are duplicates.

Show its annotations in the report as their own subsection, next to (not
inside) the findings they annotate — same separation the finding schema
itself draws between a reviewer's claim (`severity`, `problem`, …) and what
became of it (`disposition`), which a reviewer never states and this pass
does not either.
